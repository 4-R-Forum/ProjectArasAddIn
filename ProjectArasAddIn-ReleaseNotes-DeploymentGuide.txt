Project Aras AddIn

Release notes

This AddIn provides functionality to Import and Export MS Project .mpp files to and from Aras Innovator Projects. v0.3 supports 64-bit applications Project 2019 and is tested with Innovator v12SP3 and Project v12.0R1. Different AddIns will be required for 32-bit versions such as Project 2010 and earlier. Earlier Project Import Export packages used .Net controls which are not supported by standards based browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

v0.3 returns to the use of SQL Items for project download, the recursive Method in v0.2 runs out of memory for anything but small projects. Some in the community eschew the use of SQL Items, however they are a necessary part of the released Project Application. One of the objections to the use of SQL is that it does not act upon AML permissions. Project WBS structure and the critiacal path method for scheduling must act upon a single set of data. Consequently the application of user permissions would defeat the principles of project managment.
